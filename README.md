Application Name: HotGamesWithFriends
Application Description: 
Our product will provide value to users by centralizing important and interesting data about games, specific communities, and users‚Äô personalized communities. HotGamesWithFriends will be a web app that consolidates all the information users need about their favorite games and helps them connect with other users in the community. We will have two primary focuses, users and overall games. 
With ‚Äúusers‚Äù we will granulate our scope to specific users and their personal games. Users will be able to view specific information about themselves in their favorite games AND information about that community. They will also be able to connect with top players in each of their favorite games. 
Our ‚Äúoverall games'' focus will be expanding our scope to the overall gaming community, providing users with helpful information about a wide list of games. Users will be able to view a list of the most popular games (filtered by all games OR by genre), while also being able to filter using a variety of different sub variables. Some of the filter variables may include, most copies sold, most hours played, rating, current players online, and more. In addition, users will also be able to click on specific games to view that specific community‚Äôs data.
